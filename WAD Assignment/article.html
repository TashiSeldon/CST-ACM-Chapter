		    <h3>Drones change the war in Ukraine</h3>
		    <p>The war in Ukraine was deadlier in its third year than the first two years combined due to the use of weaponized drones. According to Roman Kostenko, chair of the defense and intelligence committee in Ukraine's Parliament, around 70% of Russian and Ukrainian casualties can be attributed to drones. Both Ukrainian and Russian officials estimate that 3 million to 4 million drones will be made in each country this year. Ukrainian Colonel Vadym Sukharevsky said the country has adopted a "robots first" military strategy.</p>

		    <h3>U.S. Charges Chinese Hackers, Government Officials in Broad Cybercrime Campaign</h3>
		    <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged 12 Chinese nationals in connection with global cybercrime campaigns. In one indictment, eight leaders and employees of alleged private hacking company I-Soon were charged for computer breaches targeting U.S.-based Chinese dissidents, religious organizations, media outlets, a research university, and the Defense Intelligence Agency. In a separate indictment, two Chinese hackers were charged for a purported for-profit hacking campaign targeting U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors, and healthcare systems.</p>
